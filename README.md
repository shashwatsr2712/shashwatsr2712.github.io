* A music player web application which allows user to add songs to a playlist and play.
* Selection can be made from the device. When a file is selected, its metadata (title, artist, album, cover art) is stored.
* Several files can be added to form a playlist. On selecting a particular item, its details and audio controls are displayed.
* For extracting tags from music files, Javascript ID3 reader has been used from the following repository: https://github.com/aadsm/JavaScript-ID3-Reader/blob/master/example/index.html#L46
## Update (New features & improvements):
* Repetition can be turned on/off by clicking on 'Repeat' button.
* Autoplay feature has been added now, which automatically starts playing the next song in queue after a song ends, unless 'Repeat' mode is on.
* BootStrap 4 has been used, replacing BootStrap 3.
* Playlist and buttons (Repeat and Input) are now accessible from collapsible Navbar. 
## Update (New feature):
* 'Previous' and 'Next' icons added.
* Clicking on Next plays the next song in queue.
* Clicking on Previous restarts the song if current Play time > 3 seconds. If it is less than 3 seconds, previous song in queue is played.   
### Update (Fix):
Non-scrolling navbar issue fixed for mobile devices.
