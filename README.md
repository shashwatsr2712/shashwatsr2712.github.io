* A music player web application which allows user to add songs to a playlist and play.

* Several files can be added to form a playlist. On selecting a particular item, its details and audio controls are displayed.
* For extracting tags from music files, Javascript ID3 reader has been used from the following repository: https://github.com/aadsm/JavaScript-ID3-Reader/blob/master/example/index.html#L46
